Project name: Health Credit (Software Engineering Project)

Description: Health Credit is a developed provider finder. In encapsulates all functions a person would need in order to search for a provider near them. 
Providers can be found via name or practice and location. Through hard work we have developed a sample CSV of providers, as well as an option for providers 
themselves to upload CSV's to update the system. This site we have created is a small scale version of possibilities and potential.

Access: In order to obtain access to this site, you may visit it at: 
healthcredit.tk 
-Due to this project being an in class project, it is still lacking some security features. 
It's main focus is on functionality as well as cohesiveness of navigating and utilizing the site.

Usage: This site is equipt with a predetermined file of providers ranging over several states and practices. 
That being said, it is best to upload your own sample CSV to test the search criteria and function. 
Provider searching can be managed directly from the bottom of the home page or through the 'Locator' tab.

Credits: Arkit Pawar- Arkit is out developer for this project. His role was to tackle the front and back end development of the project.
Arkit organized the developmental path of creating our thoughts and ideas into reality. Arkit participated in weekly meetings as well as
branched beyond the assignment expectations by adding additional features to the site. 
Arkit managed his development while communicating with other members regarding bugs, wire framing and business requirements.

Kaitlynn Nieves- Kaitlynn Nieves is our project manager for this project. Her role included assigning roles and over-seeing the development of the project.
Kaitlynn organized weekly meetings in which the group gathered via Zoom to go over each stage of development throughout the process.
These meetings lasted anywhere between 30 minutes to a few hours in order to orchestrate an efficient final product. 
She also aided in managing deadlines, peer encouragment and was the point of contact between the group and their assigning professor.

Jacob Martin- Jacob Martin is our user experience expert for this project. His role was to create a real visual of our project and help establish the building 
blocks of our ideas. Jacob learned wire framing in order to provide us with a base iteration of our site and the different ways it can appear as well as funtion. 
Jacob worked along with Arkit to integrate his wire frames into the developmental process.

Charles Marinelli- Charles is our business analyst for this project. Charles helped us get on our feet to kick off this project.
Charles crafted uses cases in accordance to our business requirements. He defined functional goals as well as defined the conditions
needed to fulfill these goals. He provided expected results from commands and user tasks as well as defined alternate results.

Margaret Moore- Margaret is our quality assurance manager for this project. Margaret played a critical role in creating test cases for our site upon deployment.
Margaret also developed our client acceptance testing and worked alongside our developer through user bug testing. 
She helped define bugs from the user interface as well as helped in analyzing what adjustments could improve the quality of the site.
